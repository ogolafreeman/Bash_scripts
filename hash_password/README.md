# Hashing Passwords with bash script

The script will prompt you to enter the password, and after you press Enter, it will display the hashed value of the password using SHA-256. Note that this is a simple demonstration and should not be used for secure password storage. For real-world applications, consider using more robust password hashing libraries and techniques, such as using salted hashes and key stretching algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2.

# Use below command to run the script
./hash_password.sh

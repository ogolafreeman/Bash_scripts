# bash script that reads the hashed password from password.txt file
Here's a bash script that reads the hashed password from password.txt, prompts the user to enter a password, and checks if the entered password matches the stored hashed password. If the passwords match, it will output a success message; otherwise, it will display an error message.

The script will read the hashed password from password.txt, prompt you to enter the password, compare the entered password's hash with the stored hash, and output either a success message or an error message based on the comparison result.

Keep in mind that this is a simple demonstration and should not be used for production or secure password authentication. In real-world scenarios, consider using dedicated password hashing libraries and secure authentication mechanisms.
